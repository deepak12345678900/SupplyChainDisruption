      "3. **Transportation Disruptions** - Reason: Inclement weather, traffic congestion, or road closures can impede fuel transportation, affecting the supply chain.\n",
      "4. **Infrastructure Challenges** - Reason: Lack of adequate fueling infrastructure, such as diesel pumps or charging stations, can hinder the efficient operation of delivery vehicles.\n",
